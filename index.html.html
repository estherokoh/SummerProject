					<h1>The First Time I Visited Shoprite</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>        	The first time I visited Shoprite was on my first birthday, which was on August 9th 2007and it was very interesting and exciting for me, first of all, when we were in the car I was very happy and can’t wait to get down from the car, so finally we got down from the car I was still happy as I was before then and I was looking at everything there like the merry go round, horse riding, and the donkey riding too.<br><br> Then we entered into Shoprite, my parents and my siblings where now discussing on what to do or ride, suddenly I saw people going on a donkey ride, then I told my dad about it my dad now we should go for it then we went for it we went inside very well and then my elder brother sighted the virtual reality show then told my mum about it then my mum now said do you want us to for it, then said yes let’s go for it then my mum told him, to go and ask how much the show is and he went and asked the  people there how much the show and they said it is one thousand naira only then back told my mum said let’s go for it then went and bought ticket for it the show after that we wait for some few minutes for our turn to reach, suddenly the lady in charge came and called us from where we sitting then she said ,please excuse me are you people Mr. and Mrs. Okoh then my  said parent said  yes they are  then me and my brother entered the show, the person that is meant to be controlling it now  came and on it then she covered our eyes with eye ogles and then wedge our hands to the chair we were sitting on ,and told us to enjoy the show and the thing start connecting by itself  then, suddenly a movie started displaying on the eye ogles, then when the movie started displaying  I felt like I was inside it, so when any bad thing to happen or the boy there want to jump from a high fence ,I will start shouting, because I used to have that feeling that it is going to happen to me, so my parents were videoing me and my brother when we were shouting, but actually my elder brother didn’t shout like that much then, about fifteen minutes and forty-five seconds the lady came and told me and elder brother that our time has been exalted then we came down for the next people to enter, so after that my mum showed me and my elder brother how we doing and also how we were shouting there ,then my dad now said, so what next for do my now suggested let’s go and eat then  we started heading to the restaurant in the Shoprite , so my mum ask me and my elder brother what we want to eat and I said I want pizza and ice-cream then my elder brother now said he also want what I want then my mum went to order some pizza then I followed her to the place where she will make the and my dad went to buy the  ice-cream and my  elder brother followed him to the  place where he will the ice-cream, but in less than thirty minutes my mum and my dad came back then we prayed over the pizza and ice-cream then we started eating and enjoying ourselves  with my dad’s tablet that we came with to the Shoprite, then my dad now put for me one of his best movie that he puts it for kids of my age then and when he puts it makes me feel happy and that is one thing I like about the movie.<br><br>
		
			But after the movie I sighted my aunty coming ,so I ran to go and welcome ,after welcoming her she sang me a HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG and gave me a well  packaged gift inside a new beautiful pink bag and she told me not to open the bag until we get home but I was too excited to open the bag, so I waiting my aunty gave me her phone to hold for so she will go and use the restroom so she left me there with my mum  but my mum didn’t know what was going between me and my aunty , so in few minutes time my aunty came and told me and my mum that she want to go and buy belt ,that in thirty minutes she will be back ,so my mum said okay so she went to the place where people are selling belt ,three minutes after my aunty left my mum stood up from the seat she was sitting on ,and told me let’s walk around  I now replied back to her  saying yes ma let’s take a walk, so when we were walking I didn’t know how got the phone misplaced and I didn’t even notice anything was in hand , so as we were moving in the Shoprite me and my mum met my dad and my elder brother shopping for a surprise party for someone I have no idea of ,but I didn’t border myself  to know who the surprise was for, but me and my mum did not stop taking the walk we taking before, so we continued  but as we are walking if  I see or my mum sees something	I like or what she like’s and she knows it will benefit us and also benefit those around us she buy there in the Shoprite, but as we were going we met aunty on the , so she said CHISOM where is my phone  then I now realized that I was not with the phone, I now told her about it so she call her number with my mum’s phone so by GOD’S GRACE someone from the places we have gone now picked up the call answered we should come and collect the phone from pep  so we went to the pep and collected and we now ,said thank you for giving us the phone safely ,so we now went outside I now saw  the Marygoround  ,then I told my parent  that I go for it so they said okay I should wait for them to go and buy the ticket for me, so I waited for them to  come back with the, so finally they came back with the ticket and I for the ride, it was  very cool on the ride then finally we went home safely.<br><br>
